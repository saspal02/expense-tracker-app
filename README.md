# ðŸ’¸ Expense Tracker App

**Expense Tracker App** is a microservices-based Android backend that helps users track their expenses automatically **without manual entry**. It leverages **LLMs and NLP techniques** to extract key information like **amount**, **currency**, and **merchant** from SMS messages, and stores them securely. The system is designed with a mobile-first mindset, aiming to simplify expense tracking for users who receive transactional updates via SMS.

### ðŸ’¡ Key Highlights:
- No manual expense entry required â€” just read and process SMS
- Authenticated user access via JWT-based AuthService
- Asynchronous communication using Kafka
- Data stored in MySQL across multiple services
- Kong API Gateway with custom plugins for secure API management
- Dockerized microservices for easy deployment and local development

This project demonstrates real-world integration of **microservices**, **message queues**, and **container orchestration**, all geared toward seamless personal finance management on mobile.
